  "MetalOpsAdvisor protocol — advisors for metal production process operations
  coordination proposals. The Advisor ingests a request (plant ID, operation type,
  telemetry) and returns a proposal with :effect :propose. Advisors never directly
  write state or dispatch actuation (the Governor and StateGraph Actor gate that).

  Concrete implementations: `mock-advisor` (deterministic, for testing)
  and `llm-advisor` (wraps an LLM).")

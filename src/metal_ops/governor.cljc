  "MetalOpsGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 3135 metal production process operations coordination actor.
  Wired as its own `:govern` node in `metal-ops.actor`'s StateGraph, downstream
  of `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of plant provenance or operational
  risk, so this MUST be a separate system able to reject a proposal (itonami
  actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. plant provenance        — the request's plant-id must be registered and verified.
    2. no-actuation            — proposal :effect must be :propose.
    3. no-furnace-control      — proposal :op must NOT be :furnace-power-on,
                                 :furnace-power-off, :smelting-temperature-control,
                                 :alloy-composition-control, or :emergency-shutdown
                                 (those are exclusively licensed operator authority,
                                 never automated).

  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off):
    4. :op :flag-anomalous-reading      — always escalates (high-safety signal).
    5. :op :flag-temperature-deviation  — always escalates (process stability).
    6. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
